# Instant_Art_Camera
This is a self-designed instant art camera system based on the Raspberry Pi. The camera system is capable of taking photos, printing black-and-white images based on the captured pictures, and generating poetry based on the visual content of the shots. Additionally, a simple graphical user interface has been developed for the system.
